realXtend Tundra 2.1
====================

Tundra is a scriptable 3D internet application development platform. It is aimed primarily for application developers, as a platform for creating networked 3D worlds with customized content.

Tundra is licensed under [Apache 2.0] and based on [Qt] and [Ogre3D].

Getting Started
---------------

Tundra uses the traditional client-server architecture for networking. After installing you will find the `Tundra` executable from the install directory, run `Tundra --help` for available command line parameters.

This executable can be configured to run a set of C++ and JavaScript plugins. You can create your own configuration file, or use the ones provided. Some examples:
`Tundra --config viewer.xml` - Starts Tundra with "viewer" set of plugins which provides an user interface for connecting to Tundra servers

`Tundra --config plugins.xml --headless --server --port 6565 --protocol udp` - Starts Tundra with the default plugin set in server mode serving UDP connections at port 6565

The Tundra server mode is used for standalone-mode editing and viewing Tundra documents. To host a 3D scene, run Tundra in dedicated mode using the --server and --headless command line parameters. The Tundra viewer mode is the client that is used to connect to a server.

See the `scenes` folder for example demo scenes and applications. F.e.x. `Tundra --file scenes/Avatar/Scene.txml`

Compiling from sources
----------------------

Tundra source code is available at the [realXtend github repository]. This repository hosts various branches for new and old viewers from the realXtend team, so be sure to checkout `tundra2` branch after cloning.

Tundra uses [CMake] as its build system and depends on various other open source projects. See more from `doc/dependencies.txt`.

### Windows

For Windows Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 build environments are supported. Here are the quick steps for VS2008 after you have cloned the git repo. Same steps apply to VS2010, just with different batch scripts.

1.  Install [CMake]. (>= 2.8 is recommended)
2.  Run `win_update_deps_vs2008.bat` to acquire the prebuilt dependencies.
3.  Run `win_cmake_vs2008.bat`, this will generate a .sln solution file.
4.  If you want to customize the build, go through the `CMakeBuildConfig.txt` and run `win_cmake_vs2008.bat` again.
5.  Open the solution file with Visual Studio 2008 and build.

See also `doc/build-windows.txt`

### Linux

See `doc/build-linux.txt` for more details. Also check out the distro-specific build scripts in `/tools`.
