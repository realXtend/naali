/// The common interface for all components, which are the building blocks the scene entities are formed of.
/** Inherit your own components from this class. Never directly allocate new components using operator new,
    but use the factory-based SceneAPI::CreateComponent functions instead.

    Each Component has a compile-time specified type name and type ID that identify the type of the Component.
    This differentiates different derived implementations of the IComponent class. Each implemented Component
    must have a unique type name and type ID. Always prefer type ID over type name when inspecting Component's
    type (performance).

    Additionally, each Component has a Name string, which identifies different instances of the same Component,
    if more than one is added to an Entity.

    A Component consists of a list of Attributes, which are automatically replicable instances of scene data.
    See IAttribute for more details.

    To retain network protocol compatibility between Tundra versions, only add any new static attributes to
    the end of the Component's existing attributes. Note that the order in the header is what matters, not
    the order they are initialized in the constructor, but the two should still match.

    Every Component has a state variable updateMode that specifies a default setting for managing which objects
    get notified whenever an Attribute change event occurs. This is used to create "Local Only"-objects as well
    as when doing batch updates of Attributes (for performance or correctness). */
