    /** @param doxygenDocDirectory The directory that contains the doxygen documentation. The doxygen docs must have been
                 generated as a flat list, i.e. without folders.
        @param functionName The function to find documentation for. Only functions in a class are supported, and the full 
                 namespace qualifier of the class must be specified. The return value and parameters are stripped if they are
                 present, so it doesn't matter if you call 'void Foo::foo(int,int)' or 'Foo::foo'. The latter form is preferred 
                 (without any whitespaces) to avoid the symbol name parsing getting confused. Function overloads are not 
                 currently supported, and only the first found function is returned.
        @param documentationOut [out] The returned documentation block is returned here as html web content. Do not pass in
                 a zero pointer.
        @return True if the extraction succeeded, or false otherwise. If this function returns false, documentationOut
                 will contain a displayable error message in html form.
        Known issues: The symbol parser does not do any king of proper C++ symbol name tokenization and parsing, but only
        performs simple string matching. Therefore as an example, calling with functionName=="void *Foo::foo(int)" will cause
        it to look for a class named '*Foo' and not 'Foo'. If a parameter list is present, make sure it does not contain
        multiple parentheses (e.g. an embedded macro), or the extraction will not work. The best result can be guaranteed if
        functionName does not contain the return value or the parameter list (no parentheses at all), and there are no whitespaces
        in the string.
