/// Represents a single object in a Scene.
/** An entity is just a collection of components, the components define what
    the entity is and what it does.
    Entities should not be directly created, instead use Scene::CreateEntity().

    Each component type that is added to this entity is registered as
    Q_PROPERTY as in following syntax EC_Light -> light, where EC_ is cutted off
    and name is converted to low case format. This allow scripter to get access to
    component using a following code "entity.mesh.SetMesh("mesh id");"
    
    @note If there are several components that have a same typename only first component
    is accessible through Q_PROPERTY and if you want to edit other same type of components
    you should use GetComponent method instead.

    When component is removed from the entity a Q_PROPERTY connection is destroyed from
    the component. In case that there are several components with the same typename, there is 
    a name check that ensures that both components names are same before Q_PROPERTY destroyed.

    @note   Entity can have multiple components with same component type name as long as
            the component names are unique.
