    <h2>Terrain</h2>
    Adds a heightmap-based terrain to the scene. A Terrain is composed of a rectangular grid of adjacent "patches".
    Each patch is a fixed-size 16x16 height map.

    Registered by EnvironmentComponents plugin.

    </ul>

    Note that the way the textures are used depends completely on the material. For example, the default height-based terrain material "Rex/TerrainPCF"
    only uses the texture channels 0-3, and blends between those based on the terrain height values.

    Does not emit or react on any actions.

    <b>Does not depend on any other components</b>. Currently Terrain stores its own transform matrix, so it does not depend on the Placeable component. It might be more consistent
    to create a dependency to Placeable, so that the position of the terrain is editable in the same way the position of other placeables is done.
