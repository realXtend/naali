<h2>ProximityTrigger</h2>
EntityComponent that reports distance to other entities that also have EC_ProximityTrigger component. The entities
also need to have EC_Placeable component so that distance can be calculated.

<b>Attributes</b>:
<ul>
<li>bool: active
<div>If true (default), sends trigger signals with distance of other entities with EC_ProximityTrigger. The other entities' proximity triggers do not need to have 'active' set.</div>
<li>float: thresholdDistance
<div>If greater than 0, entities beyond the threshold distance do not trigger the signal. Default is 0. The other entities' threshold values do not matter.</div>
<li>float: interval
<div>Interval of trigger signals in seconds. If 0, the signal is sent every frame. Default is 0.</div>
</ul>

<b>Exposes the following scriptable functions:</b>
<ul>
<li>...
</ul>

<b>Reacts on the following actions:</b>
<ul>
<li>...
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

Does not emit any actions.

<b>Depends on EC_Placeable.</b>
