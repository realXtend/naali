/** I watched Naali and Tundra Mumble functionality being developed for a long time.
    At the time the module was MumbleVoipModule and it was "over engineered" partly due to Naalis
    architectural demands. I've since rewritten parts of the module in multiple occasions,
    both in Tundra 1.x transition and Tundra 2.x transition. The complex messaging model between 
    the Murmur server -> libmumbleclient -> Tundra was always an issue. Also libmumbleclient was not developed
    by anyone but the realXtend Tundra devs and it had substantial amount of bugs that crashed our application
    constantly. 
    
    For the MumblePlugin rewrite from scratch I've decided to link directly to Google Protobufs, Celt, Speex 
    and OpenSSL to remove unwanted layers of complexity. The boost asio networking (from libmumbeclient)
    has been replaced with Qt networking. I also decided to not go and invent the wheel 
    again but read the Mumble client code to learn and in some cases reused their code as is. All source
    files from the Mumble repository https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble have been modified in some way,
    for example adding namespace to avoid collisions in Tundra and remove header file includes that are not present
    or remove whole classes or sections of code. All Mumble source code is located in the mumble subfolder 
    of this project and license notices have been preserved as per requested by the license. 
    Anyone deploying Tundra with this module will also need to distribute the license with the binary, you can find the
    license from mumble/MumbleLicence.txt.
    
    Credit where credit is due: Thanks to pcgod for the original thin mumble client written with boost networking
    https://github.com/pcgod/libmumbleclient and the folks at mumble project https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble.
    Both projects were thoroughly examined and both codebases heavily influenced how MumblePlugin turned out.

    Main features:
    - SSL TCP for tunneled input and output voice traffic and general protocol messages.
    - Encrypted UDP for input and output voice traffic.
    - Network mode auto detection and on the fly change from TCP to UDP and from UDP to TCP. This switch is done
      if UDP latencies get too high or ping stops responding. On the fly auto switch to TCP network mode should not be audible to the user.
    - Celt codec that is tested to work against >=1.2.3a Murmur and native Mumble clients.
      Essentially meaning native Mumble clients can also join the channels and everyone should hear each other.
    - Voice activity detection, mic noise suppression and mic volume amplification. Provides ready made audio wizard for easy configuration.
      VAD is self written (techniques studied from native mumble client), other audio processing uses speexdsp library. @see RunAudioWizard.
    - Positional audio playback, transmission and audible radius from active sound listener. These can be set from audio wizard. @see RunAudioWizard.
    - Extensive Qt signals for everything that is going on, easy to hook to these and provide a client GUI and scene interaction. 
      Signals can be found from MumblePlugin, MumbleChannel and MumbleUser classes. In scripting you can access this functionality with 'mumble' eg. mumble.Connect(...);
